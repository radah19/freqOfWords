I'm convinced that mattress/furniture stores exist in a quantum 
superposition of grand opening and going out of business sale.

It is both and neither at once until an observer records 
the state at which point it becomes one or the other.

But because you know exactly where the store is located, 
you cannot know how fast it is going out of business because 
of your uncertainty about its business momentum.

All around us, all the time pairs of anti-discount mattress stores and discount mattress stores 
are popping into existence, forming the quantum memory foam that is the basis for the universe. 
Without the pressure of this quantum memory foam strip malls would collapse.

We can see evidence of this when a pair is created such that one half is within 
the sales radius of a supermassive furniture store like Ikea-- 
one of them is pulled in and the other escapes as a Hawking mattress store.
